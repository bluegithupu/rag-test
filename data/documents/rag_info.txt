Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with a retrieval system. RAG systems retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses, which helps to ground the model's outputs in factual information.

Key Components of RAG:

1. Document Loader: Imports documents from various sources like files, databases, or web pages.

2. Document Processor: Splits documents into manageable chunks and processes them for indexing.

3. Embedding Model: Converts text into vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

4. Vector Store: Stores document embeddings and enables efficient similarity search.

5. Retriever: Fetches relevant documents based on the similarity between the query and document embeddings.

6. LLM: Generates responses based on the retrieved information and the original query.

Benefits of RAG:

- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved information
- Enables access to domain-specific knowledge not present in the LLM's training data
- Provides up-to-date information beyond the LLM's knowledge cutoff
- Allows for source attribution and verification
- Reduces the need for fine-tuning on domain-specific data

Common RAG Architectures:

1. Basic RAG: Query → Retrieve → Generate
2. Advanced RAG: Query → Query Transformation → Retrieve → Rerank → Generate
3. Iterative RAG: Query → Retrieve → Generate → Refine Query → Retrieve → Generate

Challenges in RAG:

- Ensuring retrieval quality and relevance
- Balancing between retrieved information and model knowledge
- Handling contradictory information
- Managing retrieval latency
- Optimizing chunk size and overlap

RAG has become a fundamental technique in building reliable AI systems that can access and reason over specific knowledge bases while leveraging the general capabilities of large language models.
